<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Bernard Mandeville's first extant book in English, <i>Some
Fables after the Easie and Familiar Method of Monsieur de la
Fontaine</i>, was published in 1703; it reappeared with additional
fables in 1704 as <i>Aesop Dress'd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Neither title reveals that,
except for two original fables by Mandeville, the book consists
entirely of verse translations from the twelve books of La Fontaine's
<i>Fables</i> (1668-1694). It is the first book-length translation
from these poems into English.</p>

<p>The only previous translations from <i>Fables</i> into English
verse appear to have been those made ten years earlier by John
Dennis. <i>Miscellanies in Verse and Prose</i> (1693) was a curious
volume of Pindaric odes, imitations of Horace, Juvenal, and
Boileau, and letters that the young Dennis had written during his
travels in France and Italy, including the well-known account of
the "delightful horrour" and "terrible Joy" that he had experienced
while crossing the Alps; there were, finally, ten fables in
octosyllabic couplets&mdash;all of them translations from La Fontaine.
A word about Dennis's fables may help to put Mandeville's into
perspective.</p>

<p>Their resemblance to the French originals is slight. Not La
Fontaine, but Samuel Butler, presides over Dennis's fables;
indeed, when Dennis discusses them in the Preface to <i>Miscellanies</i>,
he fails to mention La Fontaine, although he devotes a
large proportion of his remarks to a defense of Butler's burlesque
verse, which he acknowledges as his model.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Many people were
writing Hudibrastics in the 1680's and 1690's: the propensity of
Butler's couplet for arousing laughter had made it a fad.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>  With
its jog-trot meter, insinuating swiftness, and jarring double and
triple rhymes, the Hudibrastic couplet was ideally suited to the
mockery performed by low burlesque. All burlesque works by an
incongruity between subject and style; the particular function of
low burlesque is to debase an elevated subject by treating it in
an undignified manner.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> So it was that Butler, with the assistance
of a crazy style, had exploited the gap between the high pretensions
and the ridiculous performances of a Puritan knight and his
squire.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg ii]</span></p>

<p>But of the hordes of scribblers that followed in the wake of
<i>Hudibras</i>, scarcely any possessed Butler's sense of satiric propriety.
Where his success had been founded on the discrepancy
between subject and style that is essential to burlesque, they
employed his style with no regard for its suitability to their subjects.
Ordinary narrative poems with no satiric intent were decked
in Hudibrastic couplets for the sake of a superficial cleverness.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Dennis followed the fashion. His ten verse-fables are filled with
outrageous Butlerisms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Isgrim had all the Winter far'd<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So very ill, his looks Men scar'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He had (poor Dog!) got an evil habit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of going to Bed with the Devil a bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So that he had contracted a meen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which truly represented Famine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At sight of Steed that's one huge bit of Fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hight Isgrim's heart for joy went pit a pat.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had I not known thy Self and Kindred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n I my self should have been in dread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The <i>Crane's</i> arrival was opportune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Order'd for <i>Isgrim's</i> good by fortune.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whatever the intentions of the poet, it seems to be the property of
the Hudibrastic couplet inevitably to denigrate its subject. While
it is probable that Dennis intended his fables to be clever and
modish, and nothing more, they turn out to be travesties of La Fontaine.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg iii]</span></p>

<p>Dennis was attempting to impose on the animal fable an alien
style. From Aesop to Thurber, the chief strength of the fabulist
has been his humility: by selecting animal stories as the guise
for his moral lessons, he has hoped to disarm his readers into accepting
the truth. This strategy would seem to rule out the style
of low burlesque, for the impulse to this style&mdash;a dignified subject
to be mocked out of its dignity&mdash;does not exist in the animal
fable. In particular the <i>Fables</i> of La Fontaine, perhaps the most
graceful, concise, and witty ever written, do not respond well to
the ferocious manner of Dennis. Dennis translating La Fontaine
resembles a bull in a china shop.</p>

<p>While Mandeville is no gazelle either, he has better manners
than Dennis. The Butlerisms are still present, but they are not
everywhere and they are not so grotesque. The difference between
Dennis and Mandeville may be merely the interval of ten years,
during which the influence of Butler had faded; but this seems
unlikely, since Bond cites many examples of the continuing vogue
of <i>Hudibras</i>, even well into the 1730's.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A more probable explanation
for the difference is that, whereas Dennis was an avowed imitator
of Butler who happened to be translating the <i>Fables</i> of La
Fontaine, Mandeville seems to have been in this work chiefly a
translator of La Fontaine who was, incidentally, writing at a time
when the impulse to copy Butler's superficial qualities was almost
irresistible. The total number of Hudibrastic couplets in <i>Aesop
Dress'd</i> comes to only a handful:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They'll give you a hundred Niceties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Chicken Bones, boyl'd Loins of Mutton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As good as ever Tooth was put in....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And therefore let my Lord <i>Abdomen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say what he will, we'll work for no Man.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg iv]</span></p>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Cat, whose Sirname pretty hard was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Captain <i>Felis Rodilardus</i>....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before the Reign of Buxom Dido,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Beasts could Speak as well as I do....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Truth is, it would be a hard Case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all this should not mend one's Carcass.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even these few unmistakable instances are less distracting
than the ones in Dennis. Mandeville's verse is much like his
prose: straightforward, downright, even in tone. Here are the
first ten lines of Mandeville's "The Fox and Wolf":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Fox went on the search one Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Moon had hung out all her light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees her image in a Well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what it was he could not tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gets on the Bricks to look at ease:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last concludes it is a Cheese:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Bucket's down, the other up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He jumps in that which was a-top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coming to the Water, sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How little Skill he had in Cheese.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>La Fontaine has this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">... Un soir il [le loup] aper&ccedil;ut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La lune au fond d'un puits: l'orbiculaire image<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lui parut un ample fromage.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deux seaux alternativement<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Puisoient le liquide &eacute;l&eacute;ment:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Notre Renard, press&eacute; par une faim canine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">S'accommode en celui qu'au haut de la machine<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg v]</span><span class="i2">L'autre seau tenoit suspendu.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Voil&agrave; l'animal descendu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tir&eacute; d'erreur, mais fort en peine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et voyant sa perte prochaine....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dennis had inserted these lines in the pseudo-erudite Butlerian
manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The two large Buckets which were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like <i>Pollux</i> and like <i>Castor</i> were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How so pray? For 'tis devilish odd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To liken a Bucket to a God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one came up from towards the Center,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in our upper world strait went there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These drew up turns the liquid Element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into one got <i>Renard</i>, and towards Hell he went.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nearly all Mandeville's translations are, like "The Fox and
Wolf," longer than their originals. The added length is partly
explained by meter: Mandeville's octosyllabic line is less capacious,
as a rule, than La Fontaine's flexible one. Thus, even
though "The Wolf and the Lamb" moves with a speed comparable
to "Le Loup et l'Agneau," Mandeville takes 34 lines to La Fontaine's
29.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> More often, Mandeville's translations are longer
than their originals because Mandeville is not able to match La
Fontaine's wit and point. "La Lice et sa Compagne," an exercise
in light-footed elegance, begins this way:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Une Lice &eacute;tant sur son terme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et ne sachant o&ugrave; mettre un fardeau si pressant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fait si bien qu'&agrave; la fin sa Compagne consent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De lui pr&ecirc;ter sa hutte, o&ugrave; la Lice s'enferme.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In translating, Mandeville expands these four lines to ten without
special gain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Bitch, who hardly had a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reckon, knew not where to lay<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vi]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Burthen down: She had no Bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any Roof to hide her Head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desires a Bitch of the same Pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let her have, For Heaven's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her House against her Lying-in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' other, who thought it was a Sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To baulk a Wretch so near her Labour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says, Yes, 'tis at your Service, Neighbor.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps it is Mandeville's plainspokenness, his determination
to say all that must be said, which causes him to state explicitly
things that La Fontaine left implicit. "La Cigale et la Fourmi,"
contrasting an irresponsible grasshopper and a provident ant, implies
but subdues a contrast between art and life. Mandeville makes
the contrast explicit:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now the hungry Songster's driv'n<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such a state, no Man can know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a Musician or a Poet....<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Lyon and the Gnat" is fairly close to its original in length
(46 lines to La Fontaine's 39) and in spirit; but Mandeville does
not improve his fable by supplying the adjective "silly" ("silly
Spider") where La Fontaine had written "une araign&eacute;e," or by inserting
a line about the gnat's pride, "Puffed up and blinded with
his glory," where La Fontaine expected his readers to discern the
gnat's pride for themselves.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Another translation that sticks close
to the French in its sense is "The Dog and the Ass," in which an
ass refuses food to a hungry dog and is in turn abandoned by the
dog and killed by a hungry wolf. Mandeville adds the judgment
that La Fontaine excluded. The wolf attacks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Grizz'l [the Ass] at a distance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears him, and asks the Dog's assistance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he don't budge, <i>and serves him right;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Says he, I never us'd to fight</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Without a cause for fighting's sake</i>....<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vii]</span></div></div>

<p>The italicized words, entirely added by Mandeville, apparently
represent his conviction that the irony of La Fontaine's fable
would be intensified by the dog's sardonic comment and the
translator's "serves him right." Other examples might be cited
of Mandeville's explicitness.</p>

<p>The characterizing details of some of the great fables, however,
disappear in Mandeville's English. Although "The Plague
among the Beasts" is faithful to the original, the tragic overtones
of "Les Animaux malade de la Peste" are not recaptured; they are
perhaps unrecapturable. The ironies of La Fontaine's characterization
are ignored: the lion's "L'histoire nous apprend," for instance,
by which the unscrupulous politician poses as a deep-browed
savant; the description of the other beasts as "petits
saints," and of the wolf who condemns the innocent ass as "quelque
peu clerc"&mdash;these disappear.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "L'Ivrogne et sa Femme"
meets the same fate. Mandeville retains the outlines of the original
but treats the details perfunctorily, as though he had given
up trying to re-create the comic terror of La Fontaine's little masterpiece.
"A drunkard" is not an adequate equivalent for "un
supp&ocirc;t de Bacchus"; "very drunk" is not the same as "plein du
jus de la treille"; entire sentences are left out, such as "L&agrave; les
vapeurs du vin nouveau / Cuv&egrave;rent &agrave; loisir"; and the ending of the
poem suffers from the alteration of details and from an awkward
inversion for the sake of a rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He says to his dissembling Spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who are you in the Name of Evil?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answers hoarsely I'm a Devil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That carries Victuals to the Damn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me they are with Brimstone cramm'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, says the Husband, do you think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to bring them any Drink?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quelle personne es-tu? dit-il &agrave; ce fant&ocirc;me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;La celleri&egrave;re du royaume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De Satan, reprit-elle; et je porte &agrave; manger<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ceux qu'encl&ocirc;t la tombe noire."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Le mari repart, sans songer:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Tu ne leur portes point &agrave; boire?"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg viii]</span></div></div>

<p>Of the many differences between La Fontaine and Mandeville,
those noticed up to this point may be blamed on the latter's incapacity.
Some of the other changes may be partially justified on
the grounds that through them Mandeville was deliberately trying
to alter the tone of the poem, to give it an earthiness of spirit congruent
with his temperament. La Fontaine's "Le Lion malade et
le Renard" begins with hushed dignity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">De par le roi des animaux,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Qui dans son antre &eacute;tait malade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fut fait savoir &agrave; ses vassaux<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que chaque esp&egrave;ce en ambassade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Envoyat gens le visiter....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mandeville's translation begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The king of Brutes sent all about,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was afflicted with the gout....<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gout is a standard comic disease which Mandeville gives to
his lion to make him comically undignified. La Fontaine's lion
remains dignified and restrained throughout. (The two versions
of this fable are also instances of the relative capabilities of the
French and the English four-stress lines.) In another fable, a
tonal difference appears in some lines describing the meeting of
a haggard wolf and a well-fed dog:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Le Loup donc l'aborde humblement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entre en propos, et lui fait compliment<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sur son embonpoint, qu'il admire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And therefore in a humble way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gives the Dog the time o' th' Day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talks mighty complaisant, and vents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Waggon Load of Compliments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his being in such a Case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brawny Flank and jolly Face.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg ix]</span></div></div>

<p>The tone of polite gravity is gone; what remains is less succinct,
but more specific, and in its way effective. When Mandeville's
invention is working well, as it does in "The Wolf and Dog," it
provides, in its colloquial heartiness, an adequate substitute for
La Fontaine's refinement of tone and subtlety of detail. On the
whole, his fables are close to their originals, especially when
compared to those of Dennis, even though "the easie and familiar
method of Monsieur de La Fontaine" is something that, despite
his professions, Mandeville fails to reproduce.</p>

<p>Only two years intervened between Mandeville's translations
from La Fontaine (1703) and <i>The Grumbling Hive</i> (1705), the 433-line
fable that, through the years, would grow into that great repository
of social, political, and economic nonconformity, <i>The
Fable of the Bees</i>. It is not surprising that many of the fables
which Mandeville chose to translate anticipate the themes of his
great work. Among these are "The Milk Woman," on the self-flatery
of the egoistic dream; "The Frogs asking for a King," on the instability
of human desires; "The Wolves and the Sheep," on
political self-deception; "Hands, Feet, and Belly," on social
interdependence; and "The Lyon grown Old," on the ultimate blow
to pride.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Since Mandeville would give so much space in <i>The Fable of
the Bees</i> to his analysis of pride,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> it is appropriate that pride
engaged his attention in this early book of fables. "The Frog"
is notable chiefly because Mandeville lengthened La Fontaine's
moral of four lines to fourteen in order to glance at the social and
economic implications of pride:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So full of Pride is every Age!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Citizen must have a Page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Petty Prince Ambassadors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tradesmens Children Governours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Fellow, that i'n't worth a Louse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still keeps his Coach and Country-house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Merchant swell'd with haughtiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks ten times bigger than he is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buys all, and draws upon his Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if his Credit had no end;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg x]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he strains with so much Force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, like the Frog, he bursts in course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by his empty Skin you find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was only fill'd with Wind.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Two of the 39 fables in the collection are original productions:
"The Carp" and "The Owl and the Nightingale." Both poems
focus upon pride. "The Carp" tells the story of a young and
inexperienced English carp who swims into foreign waters to
learn "manners and arts." Warned by a herring to go home and
learn first about his own country, the carp rebuffs this honest
advice, takes up with fops, and is drawn into ruin before he
finally returns home "as vain and ignorant, / As e'er he was
before he went." The subject of the moral reflections at the end
is self-delusion in the particular form of sophisticated vanity.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The other poem, "The Owl and the Nightingale" (the longest poem
in the collection, at 181 lines), also concerns pride. The Eagle,
having looked unsuccessfully among the birds of his court for a
singing night-watchman, sends out a general letter. The nightingale
realizes with excitement that he will easily win the competition;
but he coyly refuses to go to court until sent for, makes elaborate
self-depreciations in the eagle's presence, and hold out, obviously,
for more recognition and reward. While he delays, an
owl has been persuaded by friends to try for the position and has
a hearing. Although he sings unskillfully, he manages to stay
awake. When the nightingale returns to court the next day, he is
infuriated to learn that an owl is competing against him and that
the eagle has ordered the two birds to perform against one another
that night. The nightingale protests so loudly and treasonably
that he is kicked out of court, and the owl, dull but faithful, is
declared the winner. The moral follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Princes can never satisfy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Worth that rates itself too high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What pity it is! some Men of Parts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should have such haughty stubborn Hearts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once they are courted they grow vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious Souls cannot contain<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xi]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Joy, which when they strive to hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cover it with so much Pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Saucy to Superiors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient of Competitors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' are utterly untractable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put off like our Nightingale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many with him might have been great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promoted Friends, and serv'd the State,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That have beheld, with too much Joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wish'd for Opportunity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then slipt it by their own Delays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sloth, Pride, or other willful Ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever after strove in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the Forelock once again.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In some respects this poem looks forward to <i>The Fable of the
Bees</i>. Mandeville subjects the nightingale to a brief psychological
analysis and looks on his failure with a blend of detached
pity and satiric mordancy; he strips away the sophisticated defenses
that hide the basic emotions, recommending honesty with
oneself and with others; he identifies the personal interests of
the members of society with the interests of the state. It remains
to point out that neither here nor elsewhere in this collection does
Mandeville assert that private vices are public benefits.</p>

<h2><small>THE</small><br />
<span class="smcap">Preface</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Reader</span>.</h2>


<p><i>Prefaces and Cuts are commonly made
use of much to the same Purpose; to set
off, and to explain. The latter, being too
expensive, are pretty well out of date, in an
Age, where there are abundance of fine things
to be bought besides Books. But the first by
wicked Custom, are become so necessary, that
a Volume would look as defective without one,
as if it wanted the very Title Page. Though
it is hard I should be compelled to talk to my
Reader, whether I have any thing to say to
him or not. Nay, what is worse, every Body
thinks a Man should be more lavish here of
his Skill and Learning, than anywhere else:
Here they would have him shew his Airs,
and therefore most Authors adorn their Prefaces,
as if they were triumphal Arches;
there's nothing empty to be seen about 'em,
and from top to bottom they are to be crowded
with Emblems and pretty Sayings, judiciously
interwoven with Scraps of</i> Latin; <i>though
they should borrow 'em from the Parson of
the Parish. These, I say, are the Entertainments
where they love to glut us with Wit
and fine Language; though they starve us
for ever after: Which makes some of 'em look
like a rich piece of Fillegrew Work over the
Door of an empty Parlour.  But I am resolved
my  Portico shall suit with the rest of
the House, and, as every thing is plain within,
nothing shall be carv'd or gilt without:
Besides, I hate formality, Good Reader, and
all my Business with you is to let you know,
that I have writ some Fables in Verse, after
the Familiar Way of a Great Man in</i> France,
Monsieur de la Fontaine. <i>I have confin'd
my self to strict Numbers, and endeavour'd
to make 'em free and natural; if they prove
otherwise, I'm sorry for it. Two of the Fables
are of my own Invention; but I am so
far from loving 'em the better, that I think
they are the worst in the Pack: And therefore
in good Manners to my self I conceal their
Names. Find 'em out, and welcome. I could
wish to have furnish'd you with something
more worthy your precious time: But as you'll
find nothing very Instructive, so there's little
to puzzle your Brain. Besides, I desire every
Body to read 'em at the same Hours I
writ 'em, that's when I had nothing else to
do. If any like these Trifles, perhaps I may
go on; if not, you shall be troubled with no
more of 'em: And so fare ye well</i> Reader.</p>

<span class="i0">As much intent upon his Prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any Prince in Christendom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not well pleased, that coming home,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He always found his Folks a Bed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, as Crown'd Heads have much to think,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The King would not be put upon:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One talks no wiser than a Horse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A Magpye in the Field at play<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I've often heard you sing at Night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wak'd by our unlucky Boys.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As well as you: But if you hear me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Jackanaps you need not jeer me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By <i>George</i>, says Mag, I'm not in jest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Match is made away they fly. <span class="rbrace">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King by this time thought it long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay for a Nocturnal Song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Master Magpy, and his Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were just come to their Journy's end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They told their Business modestly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are lodg'd on the Royal Tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Owl sets up his Note at Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At which the Eagle laugh'd out right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then went to sleep and two Hours after<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wak'd, and wanted to make Water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call'd to his Watch, who presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jump'd in, and cry'd Sir, Here am I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, tho his Owlship could not sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His watchfulness had pleas'd the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next day arrives the Nightingale,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With him to Morrow Night the King<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And hearing twas th' <i>Athenian</i> Bird,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One Bucket's down, the other up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He jumps in that which was a-top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coming to the Water, sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How little Skill he had in Cheese.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Ren, remov'd from all Acquaintance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits in the Bucket of Repentance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Rascal ought to have laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fault upon himself, it's said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He curst the Moon, and all fair Weather.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, there he sat, and wish'd, no doubt on't,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That to his purpose could be said.     <span class="rbrace">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy are those that don't love Cheese;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may go downward when we please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to come back again, <i>hoc opus</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All tricks are vain; my only hope is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Somebody as wise as I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hits on my Whim, or else I die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two Days are past; poor Animal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now old Time had in one Place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut a good piece of <i>Cynthia's</i> Face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as he does all things, he eats her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And takes a slice, where'er he meets her:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To see that spoil'd which had deceiv'd him,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For two or three, I thought on you,<br /></span>
